This contains a first stab at a job script for Cori.
It will run hd_root from a container (already pulled
into shifter). The script run_job.sh and jana_recon.config
should both be in the /global/project/projectdirs/m2828
directory when the job runs. Also, the raw data file
hd_rawdata_030134_002.evio should be there. All output
files will also be placed in that same directory.
